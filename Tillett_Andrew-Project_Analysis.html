			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
			<p>
	The first goal for this project is to create 6 HTML web pages and utilize CSS effectively across all pages to create the video game news site Gamefinity and target Pays Per Impression and Pays Per Click for sponsored advertisements to generate site revenue. The second goal is to persuade users to sign-up for the exclusive Gamefinity newsletter and make Gamefinity their go-to site for all gaming news.</p>
<p>Consumer goals are to find accurate, up-to-date information on current gaming trends and news while also having the option to take action and become a member to post comments in articles as well as sign-up for the e-mail newsletter.</p>
	<p>Utilizing valid HTML 5 and CSS3, the project will help meet these goals in the following ways:
			<ul>
				<li>Staging content according to human optical hotspots from left to right</li>
				<li>Styling content to be not only visually appealing, but draw in users to extend their site visit</li>
				<li>Using appropriate colors and content based on color theory and demographics</li>
			</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>These goals will also be met by effectively keeping tabs on game industry news/happenings and reporting them as soon as available, as well as updating them as soon as possible. In doing so, the site will build loyalty due to it’s reliability and efficiency.

			<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
			<p>The majority of traffic for competitor sites flows in from males 18-34 with little to no college education. This is the same demographic Gamefinity will be aiming to tap into as it is a nearly uniform pattern throughout the industry.</p>
			<h3>User Persona 1</h3>
			<p>Matt works as a full-time web designer and is a married father of 2 boys. Matt owns 2 consoles, a Playstation 3 and an Xbox 360. His boys are 9 and 13 years old and they spend much time playing the consoles throughout the day. He allows them to play games regardless of rating, however, he researches why a game is given the rating and according to what content it has he may or may not allow his sons to play it.</p>
			<h3>User Persona 2</h3>
			<p>	Ryan works full-time active duty in the Army. He spends much time in the field and uses what free time he has to play new releases on his Xbox 360. He prefers co-operative games so that he can play with friends back home. He researches the best-rated co-operative games so that when he has free time he does not have to worry about whether or not he bought a poorly designed game that wastes what little free time he has.</p>

	<h3>Bad Practices/Advantages</h3>
	<p>With the strongest competitor, IGN, users are displeased at how IGN writers appear to be “fan boys” of a specific gaming company such as Microsoft. This results in visitors being unhappy with the content because it appears biased. By taking advantage of that mistrust and advertising un-biased articles and reviews effectively, Gamefinite could draw in those visitors and gain their loyalty. Another issue is that according to Alexa.com, IGN loads 66% slower than other sites. This is due to the large amount of content on the home page and by creating a faster loading site, Gamefinite can use this as an advantage as well.</p>
